    <p>Not quite pizza and definitely not a pie you’d make for dessert, tomato pie is a Utica favorite. Unlike pizza, tomato pie is always served at room temperature. Roma Sausage & Deli, considered the place that put Utica tomato pie on the map, serves a classic version, with a chewy crust with just a bit of crunch, chunky tomato sauce, and a dusting of grated cheese. Every August, Roma and other local shops and bakeries compete for bragging rights at Tomato Pie Day in Utica, vying to win prizes for best sauce, best crust, and most unique version. Try to make your own tomato pie with this easy recipe. It’s the perfect counter-top snack for hungry kids and adults alike.</p>

        <li>Simmer for approximately 30 minutes on low heat, remove from heat.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Coat 1/2 sheet pan with cornmeal.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine yeast, sugar, and warm water, and gently whisk to combine. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
